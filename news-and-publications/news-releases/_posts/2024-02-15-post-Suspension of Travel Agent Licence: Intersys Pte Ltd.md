<p>The Singapore Tourism Board (“STB”) would like to inform the public that
Intersys Pte. Ltd. (travel agent licence number 03471) (“Intersys”) has
been suspended from conducting travel agent activities with effect from
14 February 2024, in accordance with the Travel Agents Act 1975.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspension is a result of the company’s failure to submit its annual
business profile returns (“ABPR”) and audited statement of accounts (“AA”)
within 6 months after the close of its financial year, and the corresponding
failure to pay for the financial penalty in lieu of suspension or revocation
that was imposed for the contravention. The suspension will remain in effect
until Intersys has paid the financial penalty, or for up to 6 months, whichever
is earlier. During the period of suspension, Intersys will be required
to fulfil its existing obligations to its customers, but will not be allowed
to accept new travel bookings.</p>
<p>STB takes a serious view against errant travel agents and will not hesitate
to take necessary actions to protect the reputation of Singapore’s travel
industry. For the most up-to-date list of licensed travel agents in Singapore,

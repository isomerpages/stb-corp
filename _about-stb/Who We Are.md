<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is a statutory board under the Ministry
of Trade and Industry of Singapore. It champions the development&nbsp;of
Singapore's tourism sector, one of the country's key service sectors and
economic pillars, and undertakes the marketing and promotion of Singapore
as a tourism destination.</p>
<p>The tourism sector currently contributes 4 per cent to Singapore’s gross
domestic product. Tourism plays an essential role in reinforcing Singapore’s
status as a vibrant global city that is a magnet for capital, businesses
and talent. It also enhances the quality and diversity of leisure options
for local residents and helps to create a living environment that Singaporeans
can be proud to call home.</p>
<p>STB strives to ensure that tourism remains an important economic pillar
through long-term strategic planning, and by forging partnerships, driving
innovation and ensuring excellence in the tourism sector. It continues
to market Singapore’s mult​i-faceted appeal as a premier business and&nbsp;leisure&nbsp;destination,
and offer empowering and customised experiences. We bring the Passion Made
Possible brand to life by differentiating Singapore as a vibrant destination
that inspires people to share and deepen their passions. This is a unified
brand between STB and Economic Development Board (EDB) which will allow
the international marketing of Singapore for tourism and business purposes.
STB&nbsp;also regularly reviews and updates the tourism regulatory framework
to ensure its relevance in the current business environment, while providing
support and incentives to catalyse the private sector to take the lead
in investing for growth.</p>
<p>While STB leads in driving tourism development, it cannot do it alone;
continued support from industry players is crucial in ensuring the success
and sustainable growth of the sector. In the face of growing challenges
such as resource scarcity and increasingly discerning travellers, there
is a need to focus on yield-driven quality growth. As such, STB and tourism
industry players have to work collaboratively to continue to innovate and
create value for visitors. STB also aims to facilitate the sharing of experiences,
expertise and resources among industry players to raise industry capability
and competitiveness, maximise business opportunities and forge long-term
win-win partnerships.</p>
<p>Strong support and active participation from Singapore residents are also
imperative to the tourism sector as they are an integral part of Singapore’s
identity and appeal. STB will continue to work with tourism industry partners
to nurture public engagement as part of its tourism development efforts;
every local resident is a potential advocate for tourism and together,
their collective ideas and energies can contribute to the sustainable development
of the tourism sector.</p>
<p>To navigate the tourism sector through the next phase of growth, STB will
be pursuing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/about-stb/achieving-quality-tourism.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quality Tourism</a>&nbsp;-
a model of tourism development that emphasises innovative enterprise, local
engagement and strong economic contribution.​</p>
<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
<p>The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) was first established in
1964 with the mandate to promote Singapore as a tourist destination. It
signalled the government’s recognition of tourism’s potential as an important
contributor to the country’s economy.</p>
<p>STPB started out with a staff strength of 25. That year, Singapore welcomed
91,000 visitors.</p>
<p>Under STPB, the early stages of Singapore’s tourism development focused
on raising the awareness of Singapore as a destination and building up
tourism infrastructure, including major attractions such as Sentosa Island
and the Singapore Zoological Gardens.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the Board started marketing the city as a venue for conventions
and organised events to draw visitors.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, STPB oversaw the implementation of a S$1 billion Tourism
Product Development Plan, which called for the preservation of the Singapore's
historic districts, such as Chinatown, Little India and Arab Street, the
rejuvenation of the Singapore River, and the creation of new iconic products
and events.</p>
<p>To reflect a major shift in the way tourism was championed as a key economic
driver, STPB was renamed the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in 1997. STB
expanded its role beyond destination promotion and started to establish
Singapore as a regional tourism hub for both tourism companies and tourists.
It marked a decisive move towards tourism industry development, an approach
that continues to distinguish STB from many other national tourism organisations
that focus almost exclusively on marketing and promotional activities.</p>
<h2><strong>Corporate Identity</strong></h2>
<p>The Board's new name and corporate identity were officially unveiled by
then-Second Minister for Trade and Industry BG (NS) George Yeo on 19 November
1997 to reflect the Board expanding its role beyond that of simply promoting
tourism.</p>
<p>The new identity of the Singapore Tourism Board is encased in a shape
that is derived from an architectural detail found in Singapore's Peranakan
shophouses. This, together with the 'Singapore' logotype in calligraphic
script, reflects the modern, multi-cultural yet distinctly Asian nature
of our island republic and its people.</p>
<p>The rich green colour of the identity is corporate and distinctive. It
also signifies the tropical Garden City that is home to ​STB, and continued
growth of Singapore’s tourism sector.</p>

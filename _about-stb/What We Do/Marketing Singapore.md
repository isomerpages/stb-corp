<h2>Marketing Singapore as a Destination</h2>
<p>Singapore Tourism Board (STB)'s vision for Destination Singapore is to
build on its foundational strengths to achieve agile, bold, and creative
destination marketing that delivers results. Leveraging a strong foundation
of increased global brand recognition, digital capabilities, and strategic
partnerships, STB continues to future-proof Singapore’s desirability as
a destination.</p>
<p>Our Marketing Strategy focuses on revitalising the three strategic thrusts
– <strong>Story</strong>, <strong>Fans</strong>, and <strong>Delivery</strong> –
to ensure our data-informed marketing efforts support our longer-term tourism
strategy while remaining well-positioned to cater to the future needs of
travellers.</p>
<h3>Telling a great Singapore story</h3>
<h4><strong>Our Brand – Passion Made Possible</strong></h4>
<p>Singapore’s destination brand, <em>Passion Made Possible (PMP)</em>, reflects
the authentic Singaporean identity while inspiring travel. It embodies
Singapore's distinctive ethos and mindset: a passion-driven, resolute spirit
of enterprise and determination that tirelessly pursues possibilities and
reinvention.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Brand Campaign – Made in Singapore</strong></h4>

<p>Anchored on<em> Passion Made Possible</em>, the latest <em>Made in Singapore (MIS) </em>master
brand campaign spotlights Singapore as a destination where ordinary moments
are made extraordinary. Underscoring Singapore’s key attributes – an inspiring
city in nature that is vibrant and cosmopolitan while rooted in a rich
multicultural heritage – the campaign offers a twist on the familiar in
Singapore, creating a holiday filled with wonder for travellers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underpinned by the MIS master brand campaign, STB will develop a series
of MIS global positioning campaigns focusing on various themes to support
a mix of products and experiences for varied travellers.</p>
<h3>Targeting the right fans</h3>
<p>​​To achieve quality tourism, we pursue a yield-driven marketing approach,
focusing on five high-yield target segments: Active Silvers, Early Careers,
Established Careers, Families with Young Kids, and Business Travellers.</p>
<p>We adopt a data-driven approach to audience segmentation, delving deep
into audience insights to unveil 10 distinct traveller portraits that represent
the prevalent travel types globally, based on their unique interests, motivations
and behaviours. With a deep understanding of these travellers, we continually
refine our targeting approach by tailoring content delivery across various
platforms to optimise campaign effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Enhancing our delivery</h3>
<p>To keep pace with evolving consumption habits, we continuously optimise
our existing channels and invest in innovative approaches to showcase Singapore
in creative ways, reaching a wider audience and inspiring travel to Singapore.
This includes collaborating with media companies, celebrities and influencers
to create compelling content and immersive experiences. We utilise branded
entertainment partnerships across film, television, music, and gaming.
We also venture into the Metaverse, through channels such as Roblox, the
world’s largest Metaverse gaming platform, to reimagine Singapore’s iconic
attractions within a playful virtual world and foster a connection with
Destination Singapore through interactive exploration.</p>
<p>To amplify marketing impact, build destination awareness, drive visitor
arrivals to Singapore and facilitate the discovery of experiences that
Singapore offers, STB has and will continue to explore strategic co-investment
marketing partnerships with stakeholders in the tourism and related industries.</p>

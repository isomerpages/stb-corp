<h2>Marketing Singapore as a Destination</h2>
<p>Singapore Tourism Board (STB)'s vision for Destination Singapore is to
build on its foundational strengths to achieve agile, bold, and creative
destination marketing that delivers results. Leveraging a strong foundation
of increased global brand recognition, digital capabilities, and strategic
partnerships, STB continues to future-proof Singapore’s desirability as
a destination.</p>
<p>Our Marketing Strategy focuses on revitalising the three strategic thrusts
– <strong>Story</strong>, <strong>Fans</strong>, and <strong>Delivery</strong> –
to ensure our data-informed marketing efforts support our longer-term tourism
strategy while remaining well-positioned to cater to the future needs of
travellers.</p>
<h3>Telling a great Singapore story</h3>
<h4><strong>Our Brand – Passion Made Possible</strong></h4>
<p>Singapore’s destination brand, <em>Passion Made Possible (PMP)</em>, reflects
the authentic Singaporean identity while inspiring travel. It embodies
Singapore's distinctive ethos and mindset: a passion-driven, resolute spirit
of enterprise and determination that tirelessly pursues possibilities and
reinvention.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Brand Campaign – Made in Singapore</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&lt;Embed MIS<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kij3n1iikKc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> <u>YT video</u></a>&gt; Made in Singapore Master Brand Campaign</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anchored on<em> Passion Made Possible</em>, the latest <em>Made in Singapore (MIS) </em>master
brand campaign spotlights Singapore as a destination where ordinary moments
are made extraordinary. Underscoring Singapore’s key attributes – an inspiring
city in nature that is vibrant and cosmopolitan while rooted in a rich
multicultural heritage – the campaign offers a twist on the familiar in
Singapore, creating a holiday filled with wonder for travellers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underpinned by the MIS master brand campaign, STB will develop a series
of MIS global positioning campaigns focusing on various themes to support
a mix of products and experiences for varied travellers.</p>
<h3>Targeting the right fans</h3>
<p>​​To achieve quality tourism, we pursue a yield-driven marketing approach,
focusing on five high-yield target segments: Active Silvers, Early Careers,
Established Careers, Families with Young Kids, and Business Travellers.</p>
<p>We adopt a data-driven approach to audience segmentation, delving deep
into audience insights to unveil 10 distinct traveller portraits that represent
the prevalent travel types globally, based on their unique interests, motivations
and behaviours. With a deep understanding of these travellers, we continually
refine our targeting approach by tailoring content delivery across various
platforms to optimise campaign effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Enhancing our delivery</h3>
<p>To keep pace with evolving consumption habits, we continuously optimise
our existing channels and invest in innovative approaches to showcase Singapore
in creative ways, reaching a wider audience and inspiring travel to Singapore.
This includes collaborating with media companies, celebrities and influencers
to create compelling content and immersive experiences. We utilise branded
entertainment partnerships across film, television, music, and gaming.
We also venture into the Metaverse, through channels such as Roblox, the
world’s largest Metaverse gaming platform, to reimagine Singapore’s iconic
attractions within a playful virtual world and foster a connection with
Destination Singapore through interactive exploration.</p>
<p>To amplify marketing impact, build destination awareness, drive visitor
arrivals to Singapore and facilitate the discovery of experiences that
Singapore offers, STB has and will continue to explore strategic co-investment
marketing partnerships with stakeholders in the tourism and related industries.</p>

<p>The vision we have for Destination Singapore is to build on our foundational
strengths to achieve agile, bold and creative destination marketing that
inspires and delivers results.</p>
<p>This vision will greatly enhance our resolve in the years ahead to parlay
our current strengths into even better destination marketing works, while
plugging gaps in systems and capabilities.</p>
<p>In approaching our marketing strategy (Refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/dam/stb/documents/annualreports/MS%20Paper%20Revised_July%202017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
the full strategy paper), we first looked at how destination marketing
has evolved over the years and where our various initiatives and activities
are within the consumer journey. Applying additional considerations such
as story, substance, simplicity, speed and science (Gordon &amp; Perrey,
2015), we derive 3 strategic thrusts for the marketing of Singapore:</p>

<p>In getting to the Passion Made Possible brand, we dug deep and looked
at stories of Singaporeans and residents. In the Passion Made Possible:
Unified Brand film below, we picked a few such stories to share with you.
This film is created to illustrate the brand and the attitude behind it
to stakeholders, and is not meant for advertising purposes.​</p>

<h5><strong>Passion Made Possible is at its heart an articulation of the spirit of Singapore and its people. It celebrates the stories of the big local heroes, but also the everyday Singaporeans.&nbsp;​</strong></h5>

<h3><strong>Fundamental shifts to the Brand</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are three fundamental shifts to this brand:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A unified brand beyond tourism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inside-out approach&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standing for an attitude &amp; belief</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. A unified brand beyond tourism</strong>
</p>
<p>Over the last five decades, Singapore has built a strong reputation as
a global business and tourism hub, recognised for its quality infrastructure,
safety, stability, connectedness</p>
<p><strong>2. An inside-out approach</strong>
</p>
<p>It is usual practice that the consumer is at the focus of the brand process,
with the identifying of consumer needs and insights as the start of the
process. However, Singapore is not a product, it is a country with many
facets.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Standing for an attitude &amp; belief</strong>
</p>
<p>Passion Made Possible was thus derived to capture the spirit of the nation
in a way that builds affinity, affiliation and top-of-mind recall. With
the themes of ‘passion’ and ‘possibilities’</p>

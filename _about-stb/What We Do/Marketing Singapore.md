<h3><strong>Our Environment</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Destination Singapore faces a very challenging marketing environment today.
The consumer is becoming more technologically-savvy, distracted and consequently
more demanding. Disruption is fast becoming the millennial norm and yet
there is a rapidly growing grey segment, resulting in a dichotomy of worlds
and explosion in developments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, destinations in the region, and around the world, are stepping
up their game with new tourism attractions and increased marketing investments.
Against this highly competitive scene, Singapore faces a multitude of resource
constraints while continuing to battle entrenched misperception issues.
There is a greater need for Destination Singapore to sharpen our marketing
efforts in order to realise Singapore’s ambitions in continuing to grow
tourism receipts (TR) and visitor arrivals (VA) in the next few years.</p>
<p>It is clear, however, that traditional marketing is no longer enough to
cut through the clutter. Marketing efforts by the Singapore Tourism Board
(STB) and Singapore travel industry have evolved over the years in scope,
approach and budget. But with challenges and competition arising, we need
to evolve our marketing further to better capitalise on fast-changing trends
and realise opportunities.</p>
<p>The vision we have for Destination Singapore is to build on our foundational
strengths to achieve agile, bold and creative destination marketing that
inspires and delivers results.</p>
<p>This vision will greatly enhance our resolve in the years ahead to parlay
our current strengths into even better destination marketing works, while
plugging gaps in systems and capabilities.</p>
<p>In approaching our marketing strategy (Refer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/dam/stb/documents/annualreports/MS%20Paper%20Revised_July%202017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
the full strategy paper), we first looked at how destination marketing
has evolved over the years and where our various initiatives and activities
are within the consumer journey. Applying additional considerations such
as story, substance, simplicity, speed and science (Gordon &amp; Perrey,
2015), we derive 3 strategic thrusts for the marketing of Singapore:</p>

<h3><strong>Singapore - Passion Made Possible</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the first strategic thrust of telling a great Singapore story,
we need a great brand. In today’s world where consumers have greater control
over what information they receive, brands and destinations must be able
to tell better stories to reach consumers and get their attention. Hence,
we must first have a great story, one that is of Singapore and its unique
identity and history, told in endless ways by different people. It is about
being confident in who and what we are, and not be everything to everybody.
To do so, we collaborated with the Singapore Economic Development Board
(EDB).</p>
<p>On 24 August 2017, STB and EDB unveiled a unified brand, Singapore – Passion
Made Possible, to market Singapore internationally for tourism and business
purposes. Launched by Minister of Trade and Industry (Industry), Mr S.
Iswaran, the unified brand will be adopted by other statutory boards and
agencies under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), and supported
by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).</p>
<p>Singapore – Passion Made Possible, is more than a description of Singapore,
it puts forth Singapore’s unique attitude and mindset: a passion-driven,
never-settling spirit of determination and enterprise that constantly pursues
possibilities and reinvention.</p>
<p>In getting to the Passion Made Possible brand, we dug deep and looked
at stories of Singaporeans and residents. In the Passion Made Possible:
Unified Brand film below, we picked a few such stories to share with you.
This film is created to illustrate the brand and the attitude behind it
to stakeholders, and is not meant for advertising purposes.​</p>

<h5><strong>Passion Made Possible is at its heart an articulation of the spirit of Singapore and its people. It celebrates the stories of the big local heroes, but also the everyday Singaporeans.&nbsp;​</strong></h5>

<h3><strong>Fundamental shifts to the Brand</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are three fundamental shifts to this brand:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A unified brand beyond tourism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inside-out approach&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standing for an attitude &amp; belief</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. A unified brand beyond tourism</strong>
</p>
<p>Over the last five decades, Singapore has built a strong reputation as
a global business and tourism hub, recognised for its quality infrastructure,
safety, stability, connectedness and accessibility. However, global competition
to attract tourists and investments has intensified, and the media landscape
has become more crowded and complex. Visitors have become more discerning
in their travel choices, seeking to immerse themselves in cultures and
build deeper connections with destinations, while international businesses
want to create new solutions that make a difference. The unified brand
thus aims to communicate the country’s value proposition in addressing
the needs of travellers and companies, and help Singapore stand out on
the international stage.</p>
<p><strong>2. An inside-out approach</strong>
</p>
<p>It is usual practice that the consumer is at the focus of the brand process,
with the identifying of consumer needs and insights as the start of the
process. However, Singapore is not a product, it is a country with many
facets.</p>
<p>Hence to go beyond tourism and build a brand that is authentic and true
to Singapore, it is critical to look inwards first.</p>
<p>In the development of this unified brand, STB and EDB had embarked on
qualitative and quantitative research with close to 4,500 respondents on
what Singapore stands for, reaching out to residents, industry stakeholders,
and international audiences in Singapore and across 10 countries . Respondents
shared that the themes of ‘passion’ and ‘possibilities’ best reflected
the Singapore spirit: While ‘possibilities’ was strongly associated with
Singapore as a destination, the ‘passion’ to strive was what drove these
possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>3. Standing for an attitude &amp; belief</strong>
</p>
<p>Passion Made Possible was thus derived to capture the spirit of the nation
in a way that builds affinity, affiliation and top-of-mind recall. With
the themes of ‘passion’ and ‘possibilities’ entrenched in Singapore’s history
and imbued in the nation’s psyche, and told through stories of the people,
Passion Made Possible is the embodiment of the country’s track record and
tenacity to fulfil passions and continually create new possibilities. By
capturing the spirit of the nation, the brand will speak to Singaporeans
and residents alike to build affinity and affiliation. For potential visitors
and businesses, it will also help entrench stronger top-of-mind recall
for choosing Singapore as a destination to visit and invest in.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Global Tourism Campaign</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>This brand articulates what we stand for as a country and supports the
telling of many stories about this destination and its people. It will
allow us to build a deeper and more personal connection between Singapore
and our fans and friends, even when they are not actively thinking about
travel. This brand is in line with Quality Tourism as it will appeal to
the more sophisticated tourists who are seeking more aspirational value
propositions in their travel.</p>
<p>With consumers increasingly wanting to live like locals and be transformed
by their trip, we will target the passions of our consumers and appeal
to their aspirations.</p>
<p>Passions transcend boundaries. It brings together like minded people who
have similar passions. We communicate with our target audience not by their
demographics, but by their passions – as foodies, explorers, collectors,
action seekers, and more. STB will go beyond the transactional nature of
showcasing not only just things that you can do, and focus on the aspirations
of how Singapore’s many possibilities can feed your passion.</p>
<p>By going beyond the place and focusing on the person and his or her passion,
we appeal not to what a visitor can do but what the visitor can be in Singapore.
It also tells the visitor that they can meet like-minded people in Singapore
and deepen, reignite or ignite their passions here.</p>
<p>The campaign will highlight the stories of how Singaporeans and residents
have made their passions possible in Singapore. From big heroes to everyday
locals, these stories highlight their passion, determination in the midst
of struggles and how they are taking steps to turn it into reality to make
these passions possible. Our people and their stories best convey the spirit
&amp; attitude of this place. These individuals put a name and face to
Singapore in the minds of our consumers, and bring our destination to life.</p>

<h3><strong>Join us in telling the story</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>This is about telling the Singapore story and what it means to consumers.</p>
<p>The story of Singapore cannot be told by STB alone. It would take the
combined effort of the entire industry to maximize the campaign’s effectiveness,
reach, and potential to drive conversions. Consider telling the stories
of your products with authenticity and through the lens of a passionate
individual. Shape your product to bring Singapore’s story to life by working
in the stories of our people, the richness of our culture and the experiences
that are distinctly Singaporean.</p>
<p>Apart from industry stakeholders, our domestic market is also an important
audience segment for us to share the Singapore story with. Passion Made
Possible is an expression of Singapore and the Singapore spirit. As such,
we hope that Singaporeans and residents can contribute to share their stories
and experiences of Singapore, and in turn continue to bring alive the Passion
Made Possible brand.​​</p>
